# Avatars

The goal of this project is to use [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), an iOS library from Airbnb, to create a sample app where a user can customize an avatar. That avatar will then animate certain facial expressions and actions that could be used in a practical mobile app situation.

###STEP 1 - Learn to use the Lottie library
###STEP 2 - Create a few assets in Photoshop, and a few animations in After Effects
###STEP 3 - Create an app that works with the basic animations and assets to demonstrate the use of the Lottie library
###STEP 4 - Create a robust UI so the user can easily change the avatar and sample animations, focusing on the ability to scale for more assets and animations
###STEP 5 - Flesh it out by building a bunch of assets and animations!
