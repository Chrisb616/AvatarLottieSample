# Avatars

The goal of this project is to use [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), an iOS library from Airbnb, to create a sample app where a user can customize an avatar. That avatar will then animate certain facial expressions and actions that could be used in a practical mobile app situation.
